## 🌟 Key Features:

- **💬 SpeakGPT Chatbot:** Currently on a coffee break ☕. It refuses to speak without a paycheck for its API key. I may be broke but not broken!
  
- **🎨 FALL-E Art Generator:** Unleash your artistic side with AI-generated images. Who needs paintbrushes when you have code?

- **📱 Responsive Magic:** Because even virtual companions need to look good on all devices!

- **🚀 No Backend Drama:** It's all about frontend finesse and the enchantment of OpenAI's APIs.

- **🌈 Lighthouse Report:** Almost all green (except for accessibility – blame it on the rebellious contrast).

- **🎓 Academic Stardom:** App is created in polish language, because it was a part of my engineering degree defense project.

- **🔧 Built with Vite, TailwindCSS, TypeScript:** Harnessing the power of modern development tools to create a seamless and delightful experience.
  
## Note 📣:
SpeakGPT is currently enjoying its coffee break due to financial constraints. Help me buy a cup, and it might just start chatting again!
